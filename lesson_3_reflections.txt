When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository when I want to share the development of a content with other people or
to merely have a remote backup of the development of a content.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes manually gives one the control of when changes on the remote repository are brought to the local repository.
