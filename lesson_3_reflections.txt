When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I would want to use a remote repository when I want to share the development of a content with other people or
to merely have a remote backup of the development of a content.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes manually gives one the control of when changes on the remote repository are brought to the local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forking and cloning both duplicate repositories. Branching doesn't duplicate any repository but tracks the development of a content
in a repository. Forking should be used if one is to make a repository in GitHub that is a duplicate of another repository in GitHub.
If one is to make a repository outside of GitHub that is a duplicate of another repository, cloning is a good option. Use branching
to track the development of a content in different development paths.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit is that the local git system has knowledge of the last known state of a remote even when
it is not able to access the remote, e.g. having no network access.
